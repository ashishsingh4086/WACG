# WCAG
Web Content Accessibility Guidlines is a set of recommendations for making web content more accessible to the people. It does not target 
one specific group of people. Instead it targets the entire world of web users. Web is the basic component of industry that can be used by
anyone. In order to make a feasible and reliable access to the web, WCAG defines guidlines for the structure of the web development. The 
guidliness allows web content to be more usable to users in general.
About 15% of the total population in the world has some form of disability. The disability ranges from wide variety of functional 
restrictions. People with disability might have difficulties accessing the web and to make web accessible to them, WCAG rules should be
followed. WCAG does not provide a mandatory rules. 
Web accessibility is one of the most underrated concept but should be adhered in order to make web accessible to people limited by
physical or mental limitations.
Web accessiblity paradigm is not just limited to people with disability. It is a fundamental concept and can apply to anyone. If a person
who vision has been compromised and if we can design web to accomodate their limitations, then anyone should be able to use our web feature.

# Objective

  - vision impairments.
  - using assistive technologies.
  - Cognitive issues.

  - Changing abilities with age.
  - Emergency situations.
  
# Planning for Accessbility
  As in every software development process, planning is the root for incorporating web accessibility in our web or mobile application.
  Following steps can be taken while planning for accessbility: 
  
 * Identifying accessbility goals is really important before we actually start building the project. If we try to include accessbility 
 at the end of the project then we might run into situation where we have to start from scratch or change the entire layout of the 
 web/mobile application.
 * We have to evaluate some of the tools and framworks that support web accessbility. This can give us a head start and understand
 web accessbilities in detail. Some of the useful tools and links are :
    - Dynomapper.com
    - Accessibility Checker by CKSource
    - Accessbility Management Platform (AMP)
    - Automated Accessibility Testing Tool
  
* One of the most important element of Accessbility is research. Get out there in the web and look for the best practices and tools. Google and 
Yahoo provides basic instructions for web performances that includes the web accessibility instructions.
* Always keep accessibility in mind when it comes to web development. Picture a scenario and put your self in the situation and see 
how you would want to access the web if you were physically or mentally limited.
